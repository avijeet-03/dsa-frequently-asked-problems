### Sorting based problems

#### 1) Sort array containing 0s and 1s
> Problem Description: <br>
> We are given an array containing only 0s and 1s, we need to sort the array

Approaches:
- Directly sort the array
- Count 0s and 1s and redistribute

Without using extra space
- Similar to quick sort partition
- To maintain one pointer whose job is to store the position of the 1
- When we see any zero, we want to move it to left partition
- So we swap it with the position of 1 (using pointer)

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Code:
```java
private void swap(int[] a, int i, int j) {
    int temp = a[i];
    a[i] = a[j];
    a[j] = temp;
}

void segregate0and1(int[] arr) {
    // code here
    int low = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] == 1)
            continue;
        swap(arr, low, i);
        low++;
    }
}
```

#### 2) Sort the array containing 0s, 1s and 2s

> This algorithm is known as Dutch National Flag Algorithm

Similar to the above problem we will be using partition logic but for both side
- If we get a '0' we try to swap it in the left partition
- If we get a '2' we try to swap it in the right partition
- We maintain two pointers for both of the respective partitions
- zeroPtr: first non zero partition
- twoPtr: last non 2's partition
- When we swap 2 with the right partition
- There is a new element that is coming to current position and be careful not to skip this element
- This could be 0 or 1
- Traverse till the starting if 2's partition to avoid double swaps 

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Code:
```java
class Solution {

    private void swap(int[] a, int i, int j) {
        int temp = a[i];
        a[i] = a[j];
        a[j] = temp;
    }

    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        // three partitions
        int zeroPtr = 0;
        int mid = 0;
        int twoPtr = n - 1;

        while (mid <= twoPtr) {
            if (nums[mid] == 0) {
                swap(nums, zeroPtr, mid);
                zeroPtr++;
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                mid++;
            } else {
                swap(nums, mid, twoPtr);
                twoPtr--;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

#### 3) Move zeros
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/description/
> Problem Description: <br>
> You are given an integer array ```nums``` with n integers in it. You have to move all the zeros present in the array to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the rest of the elements. <br>
> Solve it using constant space <br>
> Try to solve it using minimum number of swap operations <br>
> Input: ```[0, 2, 0, 0, 1, 3]``` <br>
> Output: ```[2, 1, 3, 0, 0, 0]```

Similar to partition logic
- Move all the non zero elements to the left
- This way the relative order will be maintained

Solution:
```java
private void swap(int[] a, int i, int j) {
    int temp = a[i];
    a[i] = a[j];
    a[j] = temp;
}

public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;

    int low = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != 0) {
            // if both the pointers are at the same point
            // do not call the swap function
            // this will make sure there are minimum no of swap operations
            if (low != i)
                swap(nums, i, low);
            low++;
        }
    }
}
```

### DP on Strings type

#### 1) Decode Ways
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/description/
> Problem Description: <br>
> A string of uppercase alphabets can be encoded to a string of digits, by replacing each alphabet with their 1-based index. <br>
> For example, "BC" can be coded to "23" and "CZ" can be coded to "326". <br>
> Given a string of digits, encoded, find the number of decoded strings.
> E.g. For "226", possible decoded strings are BZ, VF, BBF. So answer is 3

```dp[i]``` is number of possible decoding for ```s[0.....i]```
Transition:
- If current character is from 1 to 9: pick one character
- If last two characters are in the range 10 to 26: pick two character

Count all the results from both the choices
```java
public int numDecodings(String s) {
    int n = s.length();

    int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
    // n + 1 size for better implementations
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (s.charAt(i - 1) != '0')
            dp[i] += dp[i - 1];
        
        // choice for two characters
        // two range of numbers 10-19 and 20-26
        if (i > 1 && s.charAt(i - 2) == '1')
            dp[i] += dp[i - 2];
        if (i > 1 && s.charAt(i - 2) == '2' && s.charAt(i - 1) <= '6')
            dp[i] += dp[i - 2];
    }

    return dp[n];
}
```

#### 2) Edit Distance
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/description/
> Problem Description: <br>
> Given two strings str1 and str2 and below operations that can be performed on str1. <br>
> Find the minimum number of edits(operations) required to convert ```str1``` to ```str2``` <br>
> i) insert <br>
> ii) remove <br>
> iii) replace <br>
> All the above operations are of equal cost

```dp[i][j]``` is min operations required to convert ```str1[0....i]``` to ```str2[0....j]```

```java
public int minDistance(String a, String b) {
    int n = a.length();
    int m = b.length();

    int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][m + 1];

    for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j <= m; j++) {
            if (i == 0)
                dp[i][j] = j;
            else if (j == 0)
                dp[i][j] = i;
            else if (a.charAt(i - 1) == b.charAt(j - 1)) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i][j - 1];
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1]);
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i - 1][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n][m];
}
```
Can it be found by using LCS of those two strings???

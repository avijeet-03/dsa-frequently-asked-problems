#### 1) Egg Drop Puzzle
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/super-egg-drop/description/
> Problem Statement: <br>
> You are given k identical eggs and, you have access to a building with n floors labeled from 1 to n. <br>
> You know that there exists a floor f where 0 <= f <= n such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than f will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor f will not break. <br>
> Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor x (where 1 <= x <= n). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may reuse it in future moves. <br>
> Return the minimum number of moves that you need to determine with certainty what the value of f is.

Suppose we have k = 1
In worst case, we need n moves <br>
- we drop it from floor 1 to n, and the first floor it will break would be f

for n = 4 and k = 2 <br>
    The no of moves is 2

- ```dp(n, k)```: minimum no of moves in which we can find f certainly with n floors and k eggs <br>
- If one egg doesn't break that egg can be reused again <br> <br>
Suppose, we decided to drop the first egg from floor x, there are two chances
- If it breaks, need to check the lower floors: ```dp(x - 1, k - 1)```
- If it doesn't break, need to check the above floors: ```dp(n - x, k)```
<br><br>

But how to choose the better option among these two? <br>
Out of these two options, we have to take the worst case scenario i.e. maximum of two choices <br>
Transition state: ```current best = 1 + max(dp(x - 1, k - 1), dp(n - x, k))``` <br>
Final ans: ```minimum for all x``` <br>
Time Complexity: ```O(kn^2)```
Space Complexity: ```O(kn)```

**Optimization:** <br>
```dp(n, k) = min for all x[1....n] (1 + max(dp(x - 1, k - 1), dp(n - x, k))``` <br>
```dp(n, k) = 1 + min for all x[1...n] (max(dp(x - 1, k - 1), dp(n - x, k))``` since 1 is a constant and can be taken out of the expression <br>

*Observation: if x increases, the value of dp also increases* <br>
We have to carefully search for x such that the inside expression is minimum <br>
    Binary search for this position

TODO: find optimal x positions


> **Note** <br>
> Whenever we see something like ```min(max(f1, f2))```, where f1 and f2 are two functions <br>
> Try to make a 2D mathematical graph and find the optimal position using binary search

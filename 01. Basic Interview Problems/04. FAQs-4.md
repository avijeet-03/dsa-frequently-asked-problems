### Buy and Sell Stocks Type Problems

#### Buy and Sell Stocks - 1
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/
> Problem Statement: <br>
> We have n stocks listed as price[i] is the cost of the stock at ith day.
> Find the maximum profit provided we can only do at most one transaction

For each day i, if we decide to sell the stock in this day. <br>
The same stock should have been bought at ```minimum(price[0.......i - 1])```

#### Buy and Sell Stocks - 2
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/description/
> Problem Statement: <br>
> You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day. <br>
> On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day. <br>
> Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.

Since we can buy and sell any number of times, whenever we see any increase in price in a consecutive day <br>
We should make one transaction here

#### Buy and Sell Stocks - 2 - extended
Same as above problem
> We have a certain fee(constant) after selling any stock and no limit in number of transactions

We have some choices to make <br>
- If we are holding any stock: Sell it here or skip (the fee will be considered here) <br>
- If we are not holding any stock: Buy it here or skip

#### Buy and Sell Stocks - 3
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iii/
Same as above problem (no transaction fee)
> We can do at most 2 transactions

Same DP way and now we have to maintain one variable which denotes the no of transactions that has been made

*How to solve this without DP* 
- Suppose we are at index i, 
- There are two ranges, one is [0....i - 1] and [i......n - 1]
- ```This is Buy and Sell Stock - 1 problem in two ranges```
- maintain two arrays, prefix and suffix which will store the max profit in each of the ranges

#### Buy and Sell Stocks - 4
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv/description/
Same as above problem
> We can do at most k transactions

Same DP way can be done with transaction limit to set as k

#### Buy and Sell Stocks - 5
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-cooldown/description/ <br>
Same as above <br>
Any number of transactions can happen but there is a cooldown period <br>
After selling a particular stock there is cooldown of k days <br>

Same DP can solution can be used

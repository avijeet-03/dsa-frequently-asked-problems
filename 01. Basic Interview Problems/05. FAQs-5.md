#### 1) Add two numbers
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-strings/description/
> Problem Statement: <br>
> Add two large numbers which can't fit into any predefined data type <br>
> E.g. 123456789101112131415 + 123456789101112131415 <br>
> No leading zeros, negatives or decimals <br>

Approach:
- Normal addition from LSD to MSD with carry <br>

Representation:
- String
- vector<int>
- Linked List

Follow up: Can we optimise it further
- Reuse the longest string, and update our answer at that place only 
- an integer can store number till 2^31 - 1
- which is approximately 9 digits
- we will use this to read our input, a single integer will have 9 digits
- and we will use set of these integers in a vector
- ```vector[i]``` will represent 9 digits

#### 2) Majority Element
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/
> Problem Statement: <br>
> Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than [n / 2] times. <br>
> e.g. [2,2,1,1,1,2,2] Output: 2 <br>
> More than 1 majority element? No <br>
> Does majority element always exist? Yes

Approaches:
- Maintain an unordered map
- Sort and check the middle index
- Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm

Boyer-Moore Algorithm:
- We maintain a count, which is incremented whenever we see an instance of our current candidate for majority element and decremented whenever we see anything else.
- Whenever count equals 0, we consider the current number as the candidate for majority element.
- O(n) time and O(1) extra space

How is this working?
- Majority is > n/2
- and all others are < n/2

#### 3) Majority Element II
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element-ii/

#### 4) Next permutation
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/next-permutation/description/
Expected solution: O(n) time and O(1) space

Approach:
- Try to plot a graph of the following numbers
- find the first dip from the right side (since this is sorted in reverse way, we cannot improve this section)
- replace the found element with its next greater element
- and then replace the right side sub array
```java
void nextPermutation(vector<int> &nums) {
    if(is_sorted(nums.rbegin(), nums.rend())) {
        reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        return;
    }
    int pivot = nums.size() - 2;
    while(nums[pivot] >= nums[pivot + 1])
        pivot--;
    int i = nums.size() - 1;
    while(nums[i] <= nums[pivot])
        i--;

    swap(nums[pivot], nums[i]);
    reverse(nums.begin() + pivot + 1, nums.end());
}
```
#### 5) Jump Game
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game/description/

Approach:
- at each position calculate the max position we can reach from here
- anywhere is i is more than the max reachable position, we cannot move forward
- at the end we check if max reachable position >= last position
- can also be solved using DP

```java
bool canJump(vector<int> &nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int reach = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (reach < i) return false;
        reach = max(reach, i + nums[i]);
    }

    return true;
}
```

#### 6) Find duplicate
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-duplicate-number/description/

Approach:
- Sum of array minus the sum of first n numbers
- XOR of all the numbers and XOR of first n numbers

#### 7) Find 2 duplicate numbers
Problem Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/two-repeated-elements-1587115621/1

How to solve it using O(1) space? <br>
Sum technique:
- store the sum of all numbers and subtract it with sum(1...n) we get a + b from here
- do the same thing for products and divide it with prod(1...n) we get a * b from here
- using the above two relations we can find a and b
- Drawback? the product can be large and we cannot store it

XOR technique:
- let a and b are the answers
- take XOR of all the numbers and XOR it with XOR(1...n)
- now we have a ^ b as a single number
- if we merge the two sets e.g. array and 1...n
- we have ```{1, 1, 2, 2, ......., n, n, a, a, a, b, b, b}```
- which is same as ```{1, 1, 2, 2, .....n, n, a, b}```
- The problem boiled down to, we have two integers which are present once and all the numbers are repeating twice
- ToDo: write the implementations and prove the solution

#### 8) Find all duplicate numbers
Problem Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-duplicates-in-an-array/description/

Approach:
- All numbers are from 1 to n
- Use the same array to find which element is present, use it as a hashmap
- Let M be (n + 1) some large number
- we will represent all the numbers as ```A[i] = A[i] + f * M```
- whenever we find element x, we go to A[x] and increment it by M
- At the end A[i] / M will give the frequency of i

```java
vector<int> findDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
    int n = nums.size();
    int m = n + 1;

    // increment x by m, equivalent to update the frequency of x by 1
    // by incrementing with m, we can retrieve the original number
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x = nums[i] % m - 1;
        nums[x] += m;
    }

    vector<int> ans;
    // nums[i] / m will be us the frequency of i
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        int x = nums[i] / m;
        if (x == 2)
            ans.push_back(i + 1);
    }

    return ans;
}
```
